### Cleaning
[Read this article about clean coding in flutter]("https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-best-practices-and-tips-7c2782c9ebb5")
- Create widgets int uikit for common components
- Don't use directly colors or font style, use uikit
- Split widgets into sub Widgets
- Create components package for sub widgets in each features
- Specify types for class member
- Use if condition instead of conditional expression
- Use ?? and ?. operators
- User cascade operators
    ```
    // Don't
    var path = Path();
    path.lineTo(0, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, 0);
    path.close();


    // Do
    var path = Path()
    ..lineTo(0, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, 0)
    ..close();

    ```
- Use Const in Widgets

- Functionality: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code behaves well for its users?
- Complexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?
- Tests: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?
- Naming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
- Comments: Are the comments clear and useful?
- Style: Does the code follow our style guides?
- Documentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?
- How to implement code review?


**According to the above points every merge request (pull request), must meet the check-list for ensuring about any concern maybe happened in the process.**

- check branch is not broken
- check feature is fulfill
- check test-case is passed
- check code style (with lint or manually)
- check readability
- check side-effects
- check consistency with other class/package/module
- check all comments on the merge request
- The reviewer if has any point about the merge request (pull request) leaves a comment on the line.
