### Cleaning
[Read this article about clean coding in flutter]("https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-best-practices-and-tips-7c2782c9ebb5")
- Create widgets int uikit for common components
- Don't use directly colors or font style, use uikit
- Split widgets into sub Widgets
- Create components package for sub widgets in each features
- Specify types for class member
- Use if condition instead of conditional expression
- Use ?? and ?. operators
- User cascade operators
    ```
    // Don't
    var path = Path();
    path.lineTo(0, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, 0);
    path.close();


    // Do
    var path = Path()
    ..lineTo(0, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, 0)
    ..close();

    ```
- Use Const in Widgets
